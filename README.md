# red-forest-hicker

This repository attend to explore tree based algorithms (decision tree classifier and regressor, random forest, the boosting family and the isolation forest for now).
One can find an implementation example for each cases (not yet!) and an example of use plus a comparison with the performance of scikit-learn implemntation.

## [Decision Tree Classifier](./decision_tree_classifier/)
The code related to the decision tree classifier is in the folder with the same name.
A detail documentation of the class implementation can be found in the corresponding [documentation section](./doc/Decision_Tree_Classifier.md) (yet to be written).

## [Decision Tree Regressor](./decision_tree_regressor/)
The code related to the decision tree regressor is in the folder with the same name.
A detail documentation of the class implementation can be found in the corresponding [documentation section](./doc/Decision_Tree_Regressor.md) (yet to be written).
